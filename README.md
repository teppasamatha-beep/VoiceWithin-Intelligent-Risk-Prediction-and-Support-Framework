VoiceWithin is a mental health support platform that combines machine learning, AI, and journaling tools to promote emotional well-being.

Data Collection & Input Layer:Users answer simple Yes/No questions related to mental health symptoms such as stress, anxiety, depression, and panic attacks through a secure web interface. The data is sent to the backend using JavaScript’s Fetch API.
Suicide Risk Prediction (ML Model):A trained machine learning model (Logistic Regression or Random Forest) analyzes user responses and predicts suicide risk as a percentage using probability scores. Based on the risk level, the system either recommends chatbot support and journaling or gently suggests seeking professional help.
AI Chatbot Integration:An empathetic AI chatbot provides emotional support and performs real-time sentiment analysis on user messages. Responses are tailored based on detected emotional tone, offering empathy, encouragement, or coping suggestions when needed.
Mood Journaling & Tracking:Users can log daily moods using predefined icons and write diary-style entries. This feature supports both quick mood tracking and deeper emotional reflection, with data securely stored.
Notifications & Reminders:The system sends daily check-ins, motivational messages, and gentle reminders to encourage self-awareness and consistent mental well-being engagement.
